Description: The multidimensional classification accuracy analysis 
    framework (MCAA) is an extension of the selection accuracy 
    framework proposed by Millsap & Kwok (2004). Since real-world 
    selection usually involves multiple tests or subtests with 
    different weights assigned to each dimension, the MCAA framework 
    is proposed to quantify the impact of item bias on selection 
    accuracy by examining the changes in selection accuracy indices 
    (proportion selected, success ratio, sensitivity, specificity) 
    for each subgroup. The adverse impact (AI) ratio (i.e., the ratio 
    of the proportions selected between a minority and a majority group 
    with matching latent trait levels) is also provided in results.
