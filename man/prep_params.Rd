\arguments{
\item{cfa_fit}{CFA model output from lavaan.}

\item{propsel}{Proportion of selection. If missing, computed using \code{cut_z}.}

\item{cut_z}{Pre-specified cutoff score on the observed composite. Ignored
when \code{propsel} has input.}

\item{weights_item}{A vector of item weights.}

\item{weights_latent}{A vector of latent factor weights.}

\item{alpha}{A list of length \code{g} containing \verb{1 x d} latent factor mean
vectors where \code{g} is the number of groups and \code{d} is the number of latent
dimensions. The first element is assumed to belong to the reference group.}

\item{psi}{A list of length \code{g} containing \verb{d x d} latent factor
variance-covariance matrices where \code{g} is the number of groups and \code{d} is
the number of latent dimensions. The first element is assumed to belong
to the reference group.}

\item{lambda}{A list of length \code{g} containing \verb{n x d} factor loading matrices
where \code{g} is the number of groups, \code{d} is the number of latent dimensions,
and \code{n} is the number of items in the scale. The first element is assumed
to belong to the reference group.}

\item{theta}{A list of length \code{g} containing \verb{1 x n} vectors or \verb{n x n}
matrices of unique factor variances and covariances, where \code{g} is the
number of groups and \code{n} is the number of items in the scale. The first
element is assumed to belong to the reference group.}

\item{nu}{A list of length \code{g} containing \verb{1 x n} measurement intercept
vectors where \code{g} is the number of groups and \code{n} is the number of items
in the scale. The first element is assumed to belong to the reference
group.}

\item{pmix}{List of length \code{g} containing the mixing proportions of each
group. If \code{NULL}, defaults to \code{1/g} for each group (i.e., equal sizes).}

\item{plot_contour}{Logical; whether the contour of the populations should be
plotted; \code{TRUE} by default.}

\item{labels}{A character vector with \code{g} elements to label the reference
and focal groups on the plot, where \code{g} is the number of groups. If \code{NULL}
groups are labeled as 'Reference' and 'Focal_1' through 'Focal_(g-1)'.}

\item{n_dim}{Number of dimensions, 1 by default.}

\item{n_i_per_dim}{A vector containing the number of items per dimension;
\code{NULL} by default. If \code{n_dim} \eqn{> 1} and \code{n_i_per_dim = NULL},
subscales are assumed to have an equal number of items.}

\item{delete_items}{A vector; default to \code{NULL}. If \code{NULL}, only items
determined to contain bias will be considered for deletion.}

\item{delete_one_cutoff}{User-specified cutoff to use in delete-one scenarios.
\code{NULL} by default; if \code{NULL}, PS on the full item set will be used.}

\item{alpha_r, alpha_f, nu_r, nu_f, Theta_r, Theta_f, psi_r, psi_f, lambda_r, lambda_f, phi_r, phi_f, tau_r, tau_f, kappa_r, kappa_f, pmix_ref}{Deprecated; included for backward compatibility. With two groups, '_r'
and '_f' suffixes refer to the reference group and the focal group.}

\item{reference}{Optional argument for specifying the reference group.
Currently only functional when cfa_fit is provided.}

\item{custom_colors}{Optional argument for specifying colors.}

\item{PartInv_fit}{A PartInv object.}
