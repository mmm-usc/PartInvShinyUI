\arguments{
\item{weights_item}{A vector of item weights.}

\item{weights_latent}{A vector of latent factor weights.}

\item{alpha}{A list of length \code{g} containing \verb{1 x d} latent factor mean
vectors where \code{g} is the number of groups and \code{d} is the number of latent
dimensions. The first element is assumed to belong to the reference group.}

\item{psi}{A list of length \code{g} containing \verb{d x d} latent factor
variance-covariance matrices where \code{g} is the number of groups and \code{d} is
the number of latent dimensions. The first element is assumed to belong
to the reference group.}

\item{lambda}{A list of length \code{g} containing \verb{n x d} factor loading matrices
where \code{g} is the number of groups, \code{d} is the number of latent dimensions,
and \code{n} is the number of items in the scale. The first element is assumed
to belong to the reference group.}

\item{nu}{A list of length \code{g} containing \verb{1 x n} measurement intercept
vectors where \code{g} is the number of groups and \code{n} is the number of items
in the scale. The first element is assumed to belong to the reference
group.}

\item{theta}{A list of length \code{g} containing \verb{1 x n} vectors or \verb{n x n}
matrices of unique factor variances and covariances, where \code{g} is the
number of groups and \code{n} is the number of items in the scale. The first
element is assumed to belong to the reference group.}

\item{pmix}{List of length \code{g} containing the mixing proportions of each
group.}

\item{propsel}{Proportion of selection. If missing, computed using \code{cut_z}.}

\item{labels}{A character vector with \code{g} elements to label the reference
and focal groups on the plot, where \code{g} is the number of groups.}

\item{cut_z}{Pre-specified cutoff score on the observed composite. This
argument is ignored when \code{propsel} has input.}

\item{num_g}{Number of groups.}

\item{is_mi}{Whether summary statistics should be computed for strict vs.
partial measurement invariance. \code{FALSE} by default (partial).}
}
\value{
The output will be a list of 5 elements:
\item{propsel}{Proportion selected.}
\item{cutpt_xi}{Cut point on the latent variable.}
\item{cutpt_z}{Cut point on the observed variable.}
\item{summary}{Summary statistics.}
\item{bivar_data}{The mean, standard deviation, and covariance of latent
and observed variables for each group.}

\code{compute_cai} computes classification accuracy indices.
