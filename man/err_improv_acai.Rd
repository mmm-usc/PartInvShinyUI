\description{
\code{err_improv_acai} checks if any improvement observed in aggregate CAI
may have resulted from the higher mixing proportion of the reference group
masking worsening performance for the focal group. If the effect size of any
change indicating worse performance for the focal group and better
performance for the reference group is larger than 0.1, prints a warning
message.
