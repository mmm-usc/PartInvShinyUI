\title{Compute effect size for the impact of item deletion}
\usage{
delta_h(h_R, h_i_del)
}
\arguments{
\item{h_R}{h effect sizes for when the item is included.}

\item{h_i_del}{h effect sizes for when the item is deleted.}
}
\value{
Cohen's h for the difference in the classification accuracy index
when the item is deleted.
}
\description{
\code{delta_h} Computes the effect size of the impact of item bias by
comparing Cohen's h values for CAI for the full versus delete-one item sets.
}
\examples{
delta_h(0.04, 0.01)
delta_h(-0.002, 0.011)
