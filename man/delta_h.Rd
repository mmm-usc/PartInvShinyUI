\title{Compute effect size for the impact of item deletion}
\usage{
delta_h(h_R, h_i_del)
}
\arguments{
\item{h_R}{h effect sizes for when the item is included.}

\item{h_i_del}{h effect sizes for when the item is deleted.}
}
\value{
Cohen's h for the difference in the selection accuracy index when the
item is deleted.
}
\description{
\code{delta_h} Uses the formula below to compute the effect size for impact
of item bias by comparing Cohen's h values for CAI when an item is deleted vs.
CAI when all items are included.

e.g. for the improvement in SE:

\eqn{\Delta h^{|k}(SE)=\text{sign}\left(|h({SE)}|-|h^{|k}(SE)|\right)||h^{|k}(SE)|-|h(SE)||}
}
\examples{
delta_h(0.04, 0.01)
delta_h(-0.002, 0.011)
}
