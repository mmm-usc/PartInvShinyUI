\usage{
plotPropselRange(
  cfa_fit,
  pmix = NULL,
  labels = NULL,
  cai_names = c("PS", "SR", "SE", "SP", "AI"),
  mod_names = c("par", "str"),

}
\arguments{
\item{cfa_fit}{CFA model output from lavaan.}

\item{pmix}{List of length \code{g} containing the mixing proportions of each
group (where \code{g} is the number of groups). If \code{NULL}, defaults to \code{1/g}
for each group (i.e., the populations have equal size).}

\item{labels}{A character vector with \code{g} elements to label the reference
and focal groups on the plot, where \code{g} is the number of groups. If not
provided, groups are labeled automatically as 'Reference' (for the first
group) and 'Focal_1' through 'Focal_(g-1)', where \code{g} is the number of
groups.}

\item{cai_names}{A vector of strings indicating the classification accuracy
indices of interest. c("PS", "SR", "SE", "SP", "AI) by default.}

\item{mod_names}{A vector of strings indicating the invariance conditions of
interest. c("par", "str") by default.}

\item{from}{The lowest proportion of selection to consider. \code{0.01} by default.}

\item{to}{The largest proportion of selection to consider. \code{0.25} by default.}

\item{by}{The increment of the sequence of proportions. \code{0.01} by default.}

\item{cutoffs_from}{The lowest threshold to consider.\code{NULL} by default.}

\item{cutoffs_to}{The largest threshold to consider. \code{NULL} by default.}
}
\value{
Eight plots illustrating how proportion selected (PS), success ratio
(SR), sensitivity (SE), and specificity (SP) change across different
proportions of selection under partial and strict invariance conditions.
}
\description{
\code{plotPropselRange} plots classification accuracy indices at different
proportions of selection under partial and strict invariance conditions for
a given CFA fit.
