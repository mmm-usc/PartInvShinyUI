\title{Compute PS, SR, SE, SP weighted by group proportions}
\usage{
get_aggregate_CAI(pmixr, store_summary)
}
\arguments{
\item{pmixr}{Proportion of the reference group.}

\item{store_summary}{The summary table from \code{\link[=PartInv]{PartInv()}}
under partial or strict invariance.}
}
\value{
A vector of length 4.
\item{PS}{Proportion selected, computed as \eqn{TP + FP}.}
\item{SR}{Success ratio, computed as \eqn{TP/(TP + FP)}.}
\item{SE}{Sensitivity, computed as \eqn{TP/(TP + FN)}.}
\item{SP}{Specificity, computed as \eqn{TN/(TN + FP)}.}
}
\description{
\code{get_aggregate_CAI} computes aggregate PS, SR, SE, SP under partial or
strict invariance by weighting the TP, TF, TN, FP values for the reference
and focal groups with the group proportions.
